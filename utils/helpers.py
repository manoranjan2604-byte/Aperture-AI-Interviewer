# Dedicated thread pool for agents (STT, TTS) that need to spin up their own
# nested event loop via asyncio.run() inside a worker thread (whisper/pyttsx3
# are sync, edge-tts is genuinely async, so a nested loop is the simplest way
# to run either behind a uniform timeout). This MUST be a separate pool from
# the orchestrator event loop's own default executor: that default executor
# is also used by api/llm_api.py (LLM calls) and agents/meeting_agent.py
# (status polling + bot removal via asyncio.to_thread). Running asyncio.run()
# inside a thread borrowed from that shared default pool has been observed to
# leave it unusable ("cannot schedule new futures after shutdown") for every
# later call on it for the rest of the session -- including the bot-removal
# call in MeetingAgent.leave(), which then fails silently and leaves the bot
# stuck in the meeting even though the session gets marked "completed".
# Giving STT/TTS their own pool means their nested loops can never take the
# LLM/meeting-control pool down with them.
